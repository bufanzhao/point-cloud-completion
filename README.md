# point-cloud-completion
#Thank you for your attention, this is the code of our completion method with Matlab, please begin with main.m, it is easy to read and expand,  but it is the original version for our experiment and verified, so the code is a bit redundant and lacks comments, which we will gradually improve in the future.

#Some data and completion results has upload, the method only requires xyz for data, so the method does not rely on datasets, you can try using your own building point cloud data. In the completion results, some surfaces are uneven as shown in paper, to demonstrate the structural constraints of each part, you can use the parameter 'zhengping'=1 in function 'buliaomoni(datas,kk,normal_pts,juli,zhengping)' to refine the results, but if the span of the structural surface is too large, the refined results will be skewed, you can modify the function 'refine_buliao3(data_out(TFin,:))' to reach local refined, achieving a smooth effect.
